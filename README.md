# Training Application System

The Training application is a web application to help job-seeking professionals to learn employment-related skills like CV/Resume writing, interview skills, IT skills, and aptitude skills. The idea behind developing such an application was the requirement of a recruitment company to build a system that enables all kinds of operations to provide such a training platform. This application allows trainees or attendees to find all the courses provided and enroll. With more enhancements, this application could integrate into a large-scale training system.
